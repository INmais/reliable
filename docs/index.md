## RELIABLE Project

Portugal is the country in Europe where the death rate in winter has a higher correlation with outdoor temperatures, although it has one of the mildest winter climates. The same happens in summer during heat waves. This is explained by a combination of multiple factors: the fact that most buildings in Portugal do not comply with the legal requirements to guarantee minimum thermal comfort conditions for the occupants, average low income and high energy prices, and by the aging of the population, since elderly people have less physiological mechanisms to handle large and sudden variations of temperature and identified as vulnerable group.

Over the last decades, INSA has developed a national warning system for heat waves (“Sistema de Vigilância “ÍCARO") and for cold waves (“FRIESA”) with potential impacts on mortality. Based on the weather forecast, these systems calculate a risk measure at the regional and district level, which is then used by the Directorate-General of Health (DGS), the Regional Health Administrations (ARS), the Civil Protection Authority (ANPC) and local agencies (municipalities, police and fireman) to implement plans to minimize the risks of the
population (e.g. reinforcement of hospital staff during the cold or heat waves). Additionally, INSA has also created a vulnerability index to heat waves at a parish level considering 2011 census data.

The objective of the RELIABLE project is to develop a public geographic dashboard with real time information on the buildings occupants’ health risk during extreme weather events (EWE), the heat and cold waves. This dashboard will extend surveillance capabilities in two
dimensions:

1) improving the current forecasting models for risk using machine learning algorithms;

2) increasing the spatial and time resolution of the warnings, when possible to the statistical subsection level (BGRI), otherwise at least at the parish level.
